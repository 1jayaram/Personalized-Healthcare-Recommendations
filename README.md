# Personalized-Healthcare-Recommendations

This project offers a reverse disease-symptom lookup tool that helps users understand what symptoms are typically associated with a given disease. Instead of predicting the disease from symptoms, users input a disease name (e.g., “Typhoid”), and the system retrieves all known symptoms linked to that disease from a structured medical dataset. Implemented using Python and pandas, the system reads from Symptom2Disease.csv and displays results clearly and accurately. This can be extended with precaution advice or treatment suggestions using additional datasets. It is ideal for patient education, medical chatbots, and clinical decision support, particularly in remote healthcare settings where access to professionals is limited.
